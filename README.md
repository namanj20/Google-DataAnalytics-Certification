# Google DataAnalytics Certification

With huge amounts of data being produced daily, the need for data-driven decision making is essential for any firm.

Through the use of R programming and quering language like SQL, this process becomes easier. Visualization showcase findings to all concerned stakeholders can be achieved through Tableau.

This is an ongoing course, which will terminate in an in-depth case study covering all bases and fundamentals taught in the entirety of the program.

This certification involved graded assignments and exams, along with both theoretical and practical lessons by the top instructors and Google. This opens opportunities for me to step into the industry at the Junior Data Analyst Level and make an impact.
